# Strands Agent Experiments

Experimentation repo for Strands AI agents.

The intention is to use this as a template repo starter for new projects using this toolset.

## Project Structure

```
strands-agent/
├── agent/           # Python 3.13 agent experiments
│   └── README.md    # See agent/README.md for setup and usage
├── .kiro/           # Kiro IDE configuration and steering rules
└── cdk/             # (Future) TypeScript CDK for deployment
```

## Getting Started

### Python Agent

```bash
cd agent
```

See [agent/README.md](agent/README.md) for detailed setup, usage, and development instructions.

## Future

This repo will eventually include:
